    üå¶Ô∏è Hi! Welcome to the Weather Chatbot! üåü
    I'm here to help you with all your weather-related questions.

    Here are some things you can ask me:
    - 'What is the weather like in Copenhagen?'
    - 'What should I wear in Athens today?'
    - 'What tires should I use in Helsinki today?'
    - 'What is the temperature in China's 5 biggest cities today?'

    üí° Type 'exit' at any time to quit the chat.
    Let's get started! üåà
